## OnyxRidge Construction Management
Final version of the OnyxRidge Construction Management Android application.

With the OnyxRidge application, one can manage construction projects they oversee or are otherwise a part of in some way. 
This application allows for connection to a remote Firebase Instance (currently only one project, the same one). 

***In this application, one may:***
  - Generate new reports in PDF format based on a fixed template, or upload existing reports, also in PDF format,
  - Upload Photos, either pre-existing or taken through the camera, in the app, 
  - Download both reports and photos (as long as they're security allows them, more on that later)

This README.md is still in progress.
